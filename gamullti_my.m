%% Simple Multiobjective Optimization Problem
% GAMULTIOBJ can be used to solve multiobjective optimization problem in
% several variables. Here we want to minimize two objectives, each having
% one decision variable. 
%
%     min F(x) = [objective1(x); objective2(x)] 
%      x
%
%     where, objective1(x) = (x+2)^2 - 10, and
%            objective2(x) = (x-2)^2 + 20

% Plot two objective functions on the same axis
%x = -10:0.5:10;
%f1 = (x+2).^2 - 10;
%f2 = (x-2).^2 + 20;
%plot(x,f1);
%hold on;
%plot(x,f2,'r');
%grid on;
%title('Plot of objectives ''(x+2)^2 - 10'' and ''(x-2)^2 + 20''');
%%
% The two objectives have their minima at x = -2 and x = +2 respectively.
% However, in a multiobjective problem, x = -2, x = 2, and any solution in
% the range -2 <= x <= 2 is equally optimal. There is no single solution to
% this multiobjective problem. The goal of the multiobjective genetic
% algorithm is to find a set of solutions in that range (ideally with a
% good spread). The set of solutions is also known as a Pareto front. All
% solutions on the Pareto front are optimal.

%%  Coding the Fitness Function
% We create an M-file named simple_multiobjective.m:
%
%     function y = simple_multiobjective(x)
%     y(1) = (x+2)^2 - 10;
%     y(2) = (x-2)^2 + 20;
%
% The Genetic Algorithm solver assumes the fitness function will take one
% input x, where x is a row vector with as many elements as the number of
% variables in the problem. The fitness function computes the value of
% each objective function and returns these values in a single vector
% output y.

%% Minimizing Using GAMULTIOBJ
% To use the GAMULTIOBJ function, we need to provide at least two input
% arguments, a fitness function, and the number of variables in the problem.
% The first two output arguments returned by GAMULTIOBJ are X, the points
% on Pareto front, and FVAL, the objective function values at the values X.
% A third output argument, exitFlag, tells you the reason why GAMULTIOBJ
% stopped. A fourth argument, OUTPUT, contains information about the
% performance of the solver. GAMULTIOBJ can also return a fifth argument,
% POPULATION, that contains the population when GAMULTIOBJ terminated and a
% sixth argument, SCORE, that contains the function values of all
% objectives for POPULATION when GAMULTIOBJ terminated. 

%[x,fval] = gamultiobj(FitnessFunction,numberOfVariables);

%%
% The X returned by the solver is a matrix in which each row is the
% point on the Pareto front for the objective functions. The FVAL is a
% matrix in which each row contains the value of the objective functions
% evaluated at the corresponding point in X.
%size(x)
%size(fval)

%% Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problem
% GAMULTIOBJ can handle optimization problems with linear inequality,
% equality, and simple bound constraints. Here we want to add bound
% constraints on simple multiobjective problem solved previously. 
%
%     min F(x) = [objective1(x); objective2(x)] 
%      x
%      
%     subject to  -1.5 <= x <= 0 (bound constraints)
%
%     where, objective1(x) = (x+2)^2 - 10, and
%            objective2(x) = (x-2)^2 + 20

%%
% GAMULTIOBJ accepts linear inequality constraints in the form A*x <= b and
% linear equality constraints in the form Aeq*x = beq and bound constraints
% in the form lb < x < ub. We pass A and Aeq as matrices and b, beq, lb,
% and ub as vectors. Since we have no linear constraints in this demo, we
% pass [] for those inputs. 
A = []; b = [];
Aeq = []; beq = [];
lb = [0.0001 0.9999 1 0.0001];
ub = [0.9999 0.9999 2 1];
opt=problem_init('BINH1',[]);
opt.problem='BINH1';
FitnessFunction = @(x) gdf_objectives(x,opt);
numberOfVariables = 4;
%FitnessFunction = @(x) vectorized_multiobjective(x);
%'Vectorized','on',
options = gaoptimset('PlotFcns',{@gaplotpareto,@gaplotscorediversity},'Generations',10,'UseParallel','always','PlotInterval',5,'StallGenLimit',10,'PopulationSize',30,'PopulationType','doubleVector', 'Display', 'final');

[X,FVAL,EXITFLAG,OUTPUT,POPULATION,SCORE] = gamultiobj(FitnessFunction,numberOfVariables,A,b,Aeq,beq,lb,ub, options)

% All solutions in X (each row) will satisfy all linear and bound
% constraints within the tolerance specified in options.TolCon. However, if
% you use your own crossover or mutation function, ensure that the new
% individuals are feasible with respect to linear and simple bound
% constraints.

%% Adding Visualization
% GAMULTIOBJ can accept one or more plot functions through the options
% argument. This feature is useful for visualizing the performance of the
% solver at run time. Plot functions can be selected using GAOPTIMSET. The
% help for GAOPTIMSET contains a list of plot functions to choose from. 
%
% Here we use GAOPTIMSET to create an options structure to select two plot
% functions. The first plot function is GAPLOTPARETO, which plots the
% Pareto front (limited to any three objectives) at every generation. The
% second plot function is GAPLOTSCOREDIVERSITY, which plots the score
% diversity for each objective. The options structure is passed as the last
% argument to the solver.

%gamultiobj(FitnessFunction,numberOfVariables,[],[],[],[],lb,ub,options);

%% Vectorizing Your Fitness Function
% Consider the previous fitness functions again:
%
%     objective1(x) = (x+2)^2 - 10, and
%     objective2(x) = (x-2)^2 + 20
%
% By default, the GAMULTIOBJ solver only passes in one point at a time to the
% fitness function. However, if the fitness function is vectorized to
% accept a set of points and returns a set of function values you can speed
% up your solution.
%
% For example, if the solver needs to evaluate five points in one call to
% this fitness function, then it will call the function with a matrix of
% size 5-by-1, i.e., 5 rows and 1 column (recall that 1 is the number of
% variables).
%
% Create an M-file called vectorized_multiobjective.m:
%
%     function scores = vectorized_multiobjective(pop)
%       popSize = size(pop,1); % Population size 
%       numObj = 2;  % Number of objectives
%       % initialize scores
%       scores = zeros(popSize, numObj);
%       % Compute first objective
%       scores(:,1) = (pop + 2).^2 - 10;
%       % Compute second obective
%       scores(:,2) = (pop - 2).^2 + 20;
%
% This vectorized version of the fitness function takes a matrix 'pop' with
% an arbitrary number of points, the rows of 'pop', and returns a matrix of
% size populationSize-by-numberOfObjectives.
%
% We need to specify that the fitness function is vectorized using the
% options structure created using GAOPTIMSET. The options structure is
% passed in as the ninth argument.
